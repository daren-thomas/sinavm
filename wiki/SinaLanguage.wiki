#summary Defines the sina programming language, a toy programming language

= Introduction =

The Sina programming language uses reverse polish notation (RPN) to keep syntax as simple as possible. At the same time it also adds notation for creating lists and blocks. I won't be implementing namespaces (this is the feature, or lack thereof, that makes it a toy programming language in my eyes).

Sina is a typed language. Each piece of memory has an associated type.

= Types =

  * INT -- an integer (Platforms notion of an int in C)
  * REAL -- a floating point number (Platforms notion of a double in C)
  * NODE -- a node in a list
  * BLOCK -- the head of a block (references a list node)
  

"Strings" are represented as lists of INTs


= Syntax =

A Sina program consists of a sequence of literals, words, lists and blocks.

  * An integer
